# Introduction

## What is Methuen?
Methuen is a turn-based tabletop simulation framework supporting role playing,
strategy, interactive fiction, and other game variants. The core rule set is a
deterministic resource management system where players control actors via
actions through sets of encounters and scenes called campaigns.

Players play through phases starting with a scene, which leads into an
encounter.  A campaign is complete when all encounters have been completed, or
if otherwise defined by a feature.
