## Encounters
Encounters are actors on a grid. Each actor or *cast* of actors will take
turns where they can perform actions. 

*Completing an encounter must be defined by a feature.*

Phases:
- Deployment (Actors positions are determined and placed)
- Initiative (Initiative is determined for each actor or cast)
- Turns begin in descending order until the encounter is complete

# Taking Your Turn

## Turn Structure

Use this sequence each turn:

**START** → Resolve start-of-turn features.
**ACT** → Select and perform as few or as many actions as desired. 
**END** → Resolve end-of-turn features.
