## Initiative
Turn order is be defined by a *global feature* in the campaign book.
This is called the *initiative feature*. Without it, a campaign defaults to
this initiative feature:
```
Default Initiative
When an actor or cast is first deployed to a map, roll 1d100. Turn order is in
decending order. Ties are resolved by the two tied actors or casts rolling
1d100 placing the higher rolling actor or cast in the turn before the lower
rolling actor or cast.
```
