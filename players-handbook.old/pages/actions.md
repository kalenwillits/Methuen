### Action Structure

Every action has four components:

**if**: Condition check (true or false)
**do**: Effects when condition is TRUE
**then**: Effects that ALWAYS execute
**else**: Effects when condition is FALSE (optional)

**Execution order**: Evaluate (if) → Execute (do or else) → Execute (then)
