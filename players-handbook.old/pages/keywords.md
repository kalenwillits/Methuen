Action: An operation that actors perform during their turn to interact with other actors.  
Actor: A person or object to be interact or be interacted with during encounters. Actors take turns, have spacial information, actions, and have resources.
Behavior: An action that is ranked on a strategy to deterministically produce non-player-actor choices.
Campaign: A book defining content and guiding players through that content using the Methuen rule set.
Cast: A group of actors that are controlled by the same player and share Initiative.
Check: Short for a dice-check. A boolean expression to be resolved driving a two-way deterministic effect.
Choice: A multiple choice deletion, can be random or selected by players. Driving a deterministic effect.
Effect: A change to game phase, actor, or resources. 
Encounter: A turn-based challenge with actors on a map.
Expression: Short for a dice-expression, a mathematical resource injected notation the evaluates into a positive integer or zero.
Feature: A focused clearly written unambiguous special rule attached to any part of a campaign changing the way it operates.

Heading: The cardinal direction an actor is facing. (N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, NE)
Initiative: A determined measurement deciding turn order.
Location: The coordinates relative to the origin on a map to the central tile that an actor is occupying.
Map: The static graph of which an encounter occurs on.
Narrative: A type of scene that tells a story from text.
Phase: A state of the game with different rules than other phases.
Radial: Clockwise direction relative to the actor's heading. (12, [1, 2], 3, [4, 5], 6) there are only 8 directions so the diagonal directions are lumped together. Only used in campaigns where entities reference radials.
Reaction: An action that is triggered during another actors turn.
Region: A collection of tiles with the same features and or events.
Resource: A named integer that is available to all actors that must always be zero or positive. 
Scene: A phase of the game in-between encounters.
