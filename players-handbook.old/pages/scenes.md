## Scenes
Scenes is the game phase that occurs in-between encounters. They can be:
- Narrative:
    Descriptive or story-driven text setting the scene for the next encounter.
- Choices:
    Multiple choice lines of progression that lead and or affect other scenes or encounters.
- Checks: 
    Dice checks that fork to or affect other scenes or encounters.

Or any mix or combination thereof.
