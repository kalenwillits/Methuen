## Maps
Maps are artistic grids plotting spatial information between actors.

Actor position and heading is tracked using tokens or miniatures over the map.
Each square space on the grid is called a *Tile*. 
A tile contains: 
- Location
- Features
- Events

A group of tiles is called a region. A region 
can have features and events associates with it. 
Regions make it easier to assign create maps with entire sections of map using the same features.

*Campaigns must have tiles with specific features and or events clearly identifiable as such*

Events are game-phase interruptions that pause a encounter and perform a scene, deployment, or other features.

### Distance

**Adjacent**: 1 space away (cardinal or diagonal)
**Range**: Number of spaces between actors
Across the grid on direct cardinal directions, (North, East, South, West), is
measured as one space. Measuring diagonally, (North-East, North-West,
South-East, South-West), is measured by a factor of **1.5** rounded up.
This is a simplification of the Pythagorean theorem, given a (1, 1) square
would result in a diagonal distance of 1.41421.
