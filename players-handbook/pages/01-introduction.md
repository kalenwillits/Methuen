# Introduction

## What is Methuen?
Methuen is a turn-based tabletop simulation framework supporting role playing,
strategy, interactive fiction, and other game variants.  The core rule set is a
deterministic resource management system where players control actors via
actions through sets of encounters and scenes called campaigns.

The purpose of this book is to be a guide for new and existing players to
reference the Methuen rule set while playing through a campaign. If any
conflicting information surfaces between this guide and a campaign, this guide
will be the superseding document.
