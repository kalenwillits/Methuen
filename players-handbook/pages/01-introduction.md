# Introduction

## What is Methuen?

Methuen is a tactical tabletop game framework where you control actors on a
grid-based map. Your goal is to achieve victory conditions defined in your
campaign book—defeat enemies, reach objectives, or survive challenges.

Unlike traditional tabletop RPGs:
- No game master required
- All rules resolve deterministically
- Resource management drives decision-making
- Grid-based tactical positioning

## What You Need

### Required Materials

**Campaign Book**
Defines your game's content: actors, actions, resources, maps, and victory conditions. Each campaign is different but uses the same core rules.

**Polyhedral Dice**
Standard gaming dice set:
- d4 (four-sided)
- d6 (six-sided)
- d8 (eight-sided)
- d10 (ten-sided)
- d12 (twelve-sided)
- d20 (twenty-sided)

**Character Sheet**
Tracks your actor's:
- Name and position
- Resource values (health, energy, etc.)
- Available actions
- Special features

**Map and Markers**
Grid-based map showing:
- Terrain and obstacles
- Actor positions
- Movement coordinates

**Pen and Paper**
For recording resource changes and notes.

## How to Win

Victory conditions are defined by your campaign. Common examples:
- Defeat all enemy actors
- Reach a specific location
- Survive for X turns
- Accumulate Y resources

Check your campaign book's victory condition before starting.
