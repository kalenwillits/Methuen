# Encounter Systems

## Designing Encounter Frameworks

Create consistent rules for how actors interact.

## Interaction Patterns

### Direct Resolution
Expression result applied directly without comparison

### Success Check
Roll compared to threshold or target value

### Contested
Both sides roll, highest wins

## Example Framework

```
Melee Interaction System:
- Range: Adjacent only
- Resolution: Attacker rolls 1d20+Strength
- Defense: Compare to target's 10+Dexterity
- If attacker's roll >= defense, deal weapon damage
- Otherwise, miss
```

Choose one pattern and use consistently throughout campaign.
