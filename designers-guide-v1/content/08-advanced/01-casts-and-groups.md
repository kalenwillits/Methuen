# Casts and Groups

## What are Casts?

**Casts** are groups of actors sharing a single initiative and turn.

## Cast Rules

Define in your campaign:

### Formation
- How are casts formed? (Pre-game only? Mid-game?)
- Can casts be broken?

### Initiative
- Single initiative for whole cast
- How is cast initiative determined?

### Action Economy
- Do cast members share actions? (3 actors = 3 actions total)
- Or each get individual actions? (3 actors = 3 actions each)

### Resource Sharing
- Individual resources per actor
- Or pooled resources for cast?

## Example Cast System

```
Player Party Cast:
- Players form cast at setup
- Cast cannot be broken
- Roll 1d20 for cast initiative
- Each actor gets individual actions/movement
- Resources are individual, not pooled
```
