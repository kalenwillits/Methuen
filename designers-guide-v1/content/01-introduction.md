# Introduction for Campaign Designers

## Welcome

This is the **Methuen Designer's Guide**—your comprehensive resource for creating Methuen campaigns. If you haven't read the **Methuen Player's Handbook**, start there first. Understanding the player experience is essential to designing great campaigns.

## What You'll Learn

As a campaign designer, you'll create all the content that makes a Methuen game playable:

- **Resources** and their initialization rules
- **Actions** actors can perform
- **Features and effects** that modify gameplay
- **NPCs** with autonomous behaviors
- **Maps and encounters** that challenge players
- **Systems** like initiative, movement, and turn structure
- **Win/loss conditions** that define victory

The framework provides structure. You provide content.

## Design Philosophy

Methuen is built on three core principles that guide all campaign design:

### 1. Standardization Enables Portability

Players who learn Methuen can play any campaign without re-learning core rules. Your job is to work within the framework while creating unique experiences.

**Design Within Constraints**:
- Use if/do/then/else structure for actions
- Resources are positive integers only
- Expressions use supported operators
- Grid-based positioning

**Innovate Through Content**:
- Choose which resources matter for your campaign
- Define creative actions with interesting trade-offs
- Design compelling maps and scenarios
- Create unique themes (tactical combat, farming, city-building, exploration)

### 2. Flexibility Through Customization

While the core framework is standardized, you have complete control over:
- Which resources exist and what they represent
- How actors gain and spend resources
- What actions are available
- How movement and initiative function
- Map design and encounter structure

### 3. Precision Over Ambiguity

Methuen has no game master to adjudicate unclear situations. Every rule must be unambiguous and mechanically resolvable.

**Good**: "Move up to Dexterity spaces per turn"
**Bad**: "Move a reasonable distance"

**Good**: "Deal 1d6+Strength damage"
**Bad**: "Deal significant damage"

**Good**: "If Health reaches 0, actor is removed from map"
**Bad**: "If Health gets too low, something bad happens"

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is organized to teach you design concepts progressively:

1. **Design Philosophy** (Chapter 2) - Core principles and best practices
2. **Mechanics** (Chapter 3) - Designing actions, effects, features, and reactions
3. **Resources** (Chapter 4) - Creating balanced resource economies
4. **NPCs** (Chapter 5) - Building autonomous opponents and allies
5. **Systems** (Chapter 6) - Customizing initiative, movement, and turn structure
6. **World Design** (Chapter 7) - Maps, regions, tiles, and terrain
7. **Advanced Topics** (Chapter 8) - Casts, groups, and complex encounters
8. **Reference** (Chapter 9) - Templates, glossary, and quick reference

**Recommendation**: Read chapters 2-4 first to understand the building blocks, then explore systems and world design as needed for your campaign.

## Your First Campaign

Before diving deep into this guide, consider:

1. **What type of experience do you want to create?**
   - Tactical combat scenarios
   - Resource management simulation
   - Exploration and discovery
   - Puzzle-solving challenges

2. **What's the core gameplay loop?**
   - What do players do each turn?
   - What resources matter most?
   - What creates interesting decisions?

3. **What's the victory condition?**
   - Defeat all enemies
   - Accumulate resources
   - Survive for X rounds
   - Complete objectives

Keep these questions in mind as you learn the design tools available to you.

## Quick Start for Designers

If you're eager to start:

1. **Read Chapter 3: Mechanics** - Learn to design actions using if/do/then/else
2. **Read Chapter 4: Resources** - Understand resource initialization patterns
3. **Use Chapter 9: Reference** - Templates for actions, features, and effects
4. **Prototype and playtest** - Create a simple 2-actor encounter and test it

## A Note on Balance and Complexity

Every rule adds complexity. Every action adds learning overhead. Design with intention:

- **Start simple**: Begin with core resources (Health, ActionPoints) and basic actions
- **Add incrementally**: Introduce new mechanics only when they create meaningful decisions
- **Test early and often**: Playtest to find unclear rules and balance issues
- **Listen to players**: The best campaigns emerge from iteration and feedback

## Let's Begin

You're about to learn how to create engaging tactical experiences within the Methuen framework. The tools are powerful and flexible. The only limit is your creativity.

**Remember**: Great campaigns aren't about complex rules—they're about interesting decisions. Design with that in mind.
