> **Note on Race and Class**: These fields record your character creation choices but are not ongoing game state. The mechanical effects of your race (e.g., "Nord: Frost Resistance 50%") and class (e.g., "Warrior: Shield Bearer +2 Defense") are already listed in your Features section below. You don't need to reference Race or Class during gameplay—just use your active Features and Resources.
