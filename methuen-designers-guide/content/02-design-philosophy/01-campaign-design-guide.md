# Campaign Design Guide

## Welcome Campaign Designers

This chapter begins Part II of the handbook—the comprehensive guide to creating Methuen campaigns. If you haven't read Part I (Fundamentals), do so now to understand the player experience you're designing for.

## What is Campaign Design?

As a campaign designer, you'll create all the content that makes an Methuen game playable:

- Resources and their initialization rules
- Actions actors can perform
- Features and effects
- Maps and encounters
- Win/loss conditions

The framework provides structure; you provide content.

## Design Philosophy

###Standardization Enables Portability

Players who learn Methuen can play any campaign without re-learning core rules. Your job is to work within the framework while creating unique experiences.

**Design Within Constraints**:
- Use if/do/then/else for actions
- Resources are positive integers only
- Expressions use supported operators
- Grid-based positioning

**Innovate Through Content**:
- Choose which resources matter
- Define creative actions
- Design interesting maps
- Create compelling scenarios

### Precision Over Ambiguity

Methuen has no game master to adjudicate unclear situations. Every rule must be unambiguous:

**Good**: "Move up to Dexterity spaces per turn"
**Bad**: "Move a reasonable distance"

**Good**: "Deal 1d6+Strength damage"
**Bad**: "Deal significant damage"

**Good**: "If Health reaches 0, actor is removed from map"
**Bad**: "If Health gets too low, something bad happens"

### Balance Complexity and Accessibility

**Start Simple**: New campaigns should have:
- 5-10 core resources
- 3-5 basic actions per actor
- Clear objectives
- Straightforward maps

**Add Depth Gradually**: Introduce complexity through:
- Additional actions
- Resource interactions
- Environmental mechanics
- Advanced scenarios

## Scope and Player Count

### Determining Scope

**One-Shot** (1-3 hours):
- Single map
- Clear objective
- 3-5 resources
- 5-8 actions

**Short Campaign** (4-10 hours):
- 2-4 maps
- Progressive difficulty
- 6-10 resources
- 10-15 actions

**Long Campaign** (10+ hours):
- Multiple maps/world
- Complex systems
- 10+ resources
- 15+ actions
- Progression mechanics

### Player Count

Define recommended player counts:

**Solo**: One player, one or more actors
**Small Group**: 2-3 players
**Large Group**: 4-6 players
**Massive**: 7+ players (requires careful design)

Design considerations:
- Turn length increases with player count
- Complexity should decrease as player count increases
- Balance encounters for expected actor count

## Genre and Theme

Methuen supports many genres:

### Tactical Scenarios
Resource management in direct conflict situations

### City Building
Constructing and developing structures over time

### Resource Gathering
Collecting, processing, and trading materials

### Farming/Simulation
Managing crops, livestock, or other renewable resources

**Your theme doesn't change the framework**—only the content flavor.

## Playtesting

Before publishing your campaign:

###  Solo Playtest
Play both sides yourself to check:
- Rules clarity
- Balance issues
- Missing definitions
- Pacing problems

### Group Playtest
Have others play to discover:
- Confusing rules
- Unintended strategies
- Engagement level
- Actual play time

### Iterate
Revise based on feedback:
- Clarify ambiguous rules
- Rebalance overpowered elements
- Add missing content
- Simplify where needed

## Campaign Book Structure

Organize your campaign book for easy reference:

**1. Introduction**
- Theme and genre
- Recommended players
- Required materials
- Estimated play time

**2. Setup Guide**
- Actor creation steps
- Starting resources
- Map placement
- Initial scenario

**3. Resource Glossary**
- Alphabetical resource list
- Initialization rules
- Special properties

**4. Action Reference**
- All available actions
- Organized by category or alphabetically

**5. Features and Effects**
- Passive rules
- Triggered effects
- Environmental mechanics

**6. Maps and Scenarios**
- Map layouts
- Tile properties
- Encounter details
- Objectives

**7. Quick Reference**
- Turn structure summary
- Common calculations
- Important tables

## Design Principles

### Economy of Resources

Don't create resources that:
- Are only used once
- Duplicate other resources
- Add complexity without depth

### Meaningful Choices

Every action should present decisions:
- Spend resources now or save?
- Target this actor or that one?
- Move closer or maintain distance?

### Clear Feedback

Players should always know:
- Current game state
- Available options
- Consequences of choices

### Fail States

Define clearly what happens when:
- Resources reach zero
- Objectives fail
- Time/turns run out
