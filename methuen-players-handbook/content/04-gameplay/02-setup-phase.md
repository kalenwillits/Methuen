# Setup Phase

## Overview

The **setup phase** occurs before gameplay begins. During setup, you create your actor, initialize resources, and prepare for the first turn.

## Actor Creation

### Step 1: Create Character Sheet

Prepare a blank character sheet with sections for:

- **Name**: Your actor's identifier
- **Resources**: Value tracking
- **Actions**: Available operations
- **Features**: Passive rules
- **Location**: Map position
- **Heading**: Facing direction

### Step 2: Name Your Actor

Choose a name that distinguishes your actor from others. This name will be used throughout gameplay.

### Step 3: Follow Campaign Instructions

Campaign books provide specific creation steps, which may include:

- **Background Selection**: Choose from predefined options
- **Initial Resource Assignment**: Roll or select starting resource values
- **Starting Actions**: Add specific actions to your sheet
- **Starting Features**: Note passive rules that apply to your actor

### Step 4: Initialize Required Resources

Some campaigns require certain resources to be initialized during setup:

1. Find the resource in the campaign's glossary
2. Follow its initialization rule
3. Record the value on your character sheet

**Example**:
```
Strength: Roll 1d20
→ Rolls 14, records "Strength: 14"

Constitution: Roll 1d20
→ Rolls 9, records "Constitution: 9"

Health: 1d20+Constitution
→ Rolls 12, adds Constitution 9, records "Health: 21"
```

### Step 5: Record Starting Actions and Features

Write down all actions and features your actor begins with. Campaigns typically provide a starting package.

**Example Starting Package**:
- Actions: Move, Basic Interaction, Rest
- Features: Single Action Per Turn, Dexterous Movement

## Map Placement

### Determining Starting Location

Campaigns specify how to determine starting positions:

**Fixed Start**: "All actors begin at 5N 10W"

**Table Start**: "Roll 1d10 on the Starting Position table"

**Choice Start**: "Choose any tile marked 'Safe Zone'"

### Recording Location

Write your starting coordinates on your character sheet:
- Location: 5N 10W
- Heading: N (or as specified by campaign)

## Initiative

### Rolling Initiative

If the campaign defines an initiative system, roll initiative during setup:

1. Find the initiative rule in the campaign
2. Calculate or roll your initiative value
3. Record the result

**Example**:
```
Initiative System: 1d10×Strength
Strength: 14
Roll 1d10: 7
Initiative: 7×14 = 98
```

### Turn Order

Once all players have rolled initiative, arrange turn order from highest to lowest. Ties are broken by re-rolling until order is determined.

## Understanding Your Starting State

Before gameplay begins, ensure you understand:

### Your Resources
- Which resources you have initialized
- Which resources exist but are still at 0 (lazy initialization)
- How resources interact with your actions

### Your Actions
- What each action does (if/do/then/else structure)
- Costs associated with actions
- Valid targets for each action

### Your Movement
- How far you can move per turn
- Movement cost for different terrain
- Whether you can move and act in the same turn

### Your Position
- Where you are on the map
- What tiles surround you
- Which direction you're facing
