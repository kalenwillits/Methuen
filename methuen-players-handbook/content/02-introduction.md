# Introduction

## What is Methuen?

**Methuen** is a tabletop game framework for tactical resource management. It
provides a standardized ruleset that campaign designers can use to create
diverse gaming experiences—from tactical scenarios to resource management
simulations, city builders to farming games.

### Core Philosophy

Methuen is built on three principles:

1. **Standardization**: Core rules remain consistent across all campaigns
2. **Flexibility**: Content and mechanics can be completely customized
3. **Precision**: All game elements are measured and unambiguous

### What Makes Methuen Different

Unlike traditional tabletop roleplaying games, Methuen focuses on:

- **Discrete actions**: Actors perform specific, well-defined operations
- **Resource management**: All game states are tracked through measurable resources
- **Tactical decision-making**: Success comes from strategic resource allocation
- **No game master**: Rules

 resolve all situations without adjudication

### Who This Framework Is For

**Players** will learn how to:
- Read campaign books and create actors
- Execute turns and perform actions
- Navigate tactical encounters

**Campaign Designers** will learn how to:
- Create balanced resource economies
- Design meaningful actor interactions
- Build engaging tactical scenarios
- Support multiple genres within the framework

## How to Use This Handbook

This handbook is organized into three major sections:

### Part I: Fundamentals (Chapters 1-7)
Essential rules for players. Read these chapters to understand how to play any Methuen campaign.

### Part II: Campaign Design (Chapters 8-20)
Comprehensive guide for creating campaigns. Campaign designers should read Part I first, then proceed through these chapters to learn the framework's design tools.

### Part III: Reference (Appendices A-B)
Templates, glossary, and quick reference materials. Use these as needed during play and design.
