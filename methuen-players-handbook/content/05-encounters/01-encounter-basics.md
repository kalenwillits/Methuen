# Encounter Basics

## What is an Encounter?

**Definition**: An **encounter** is any situation where actors interact with each other, the environment, or challenges defined by the campaign.

Encounters can be:
- **Tactical scenarios**: Positioning and resource management against opponents
- **Resource challenges**: Gathering or managing limited resources
- **Environmental puzzles**: Navigating terrain or obstacles
- **Social/economic exchanges**: Trading or negotiating (if supported by campaign)

## Range and Distance

### Measuring Distance

Distance is measured in **spaces** on the grid.

**Cardinal Distance** (N, E, S, W): Count spaces directly
- 3 spaces North = 3 spaces

**Diagonal Distance** (NE, SE, SW, NW): Each diagonal counts as 1.5 spaces rounded up.

### Range Categories

Actions specify range in these ways:

**Self**: Affects only the acting actor

**Adjacent**: Affects actors/tiles exactly 1 space away (any direction)

**Range X**: Affects targets up to X spaces away
- Example: "Range 5" means up to 5 spaces

**Line of Sight**: Requires unobstructed path to target (campaign defines obstruction rules)

## Positioning

Strategic positioning affects:

### Attack Advantage
Some actions may grant bonuses based on relative position:
- Attacking from behind (based on heading)
- High ground advantage
- Flanking (multiple actors surrounding target)

**Note**: These advantages only exist if campaign features define them

### Defensive Positioning
Position can provide protection:
- Cover behind objects
- Difficult terrain slowing opponents
- Choke points limiting access

### Resource Control
Positioning to:
- Access resource nodes
- Block opponent movement
- Control key tiles

## Actor Interactions

### Direct Interactions

When one actor's action targets another:

1. Declare action and target
2. Check range and conditions
3. Pay costs
4. Calculate expressions
5. Apply effects to target

### Simultaneous Effects

When multiple actors affect each other in the same round:
- All effects resolve in initiative order
- An actor removed from the map cannot take their turn
- Effects don't retroactively change earlier in the round

## Target Selection

Actions specify valid targets:

**Single Target**: One actor or tile

**Multiple Targets**: Specific number (e.g., "up to 3 actors")

**Area**: All actors/tiles in a defined space
- Radius: Circle around a point
- Line: Straight path
- Cone: Expanding triangle

**Self and Others**: May affect both actor and targets

## Terrain and Obstacles

### Movement Obstacles

Terrain may affect movement:

- **Difficult Terrain**: Costs extra movement
- **Impassable Terrain**: Cannot be entered
- **One-Way Terrain**: Can move in but not out (or vice versa)

### Line of Sight Obstacles

Some terrain blocks vision:

- **Blocking**: Completely obscures
- **Partial Cover**: Partially obscures
- **Transparent**: Allows full vision

**Note**: Specific terrain properties are campaign-defined

## Resource Nodes

Some tiles contain resources that can be gathered, harvested, or interacted with:

**Example Scenarios**:
- Mineral deposits to mine
- Crops to harvest
- Buildings to construct
- NPCs to trade with

Interactions follow standard action structure.

## Removal from Map

Actors may be removed from the map when:

- A resource (often Health) reaches zero
- A campaign condition is met
- An effect explicitly removes them

**Consequences** (campaign-defined):
- Permanent removal
- Temporary removal (can return later)
- End of game for that player
- Respawn at a specific location

## Encounter Completion

Encounters end when:

- Campaign objectives are met
- All opponents are removed
- Time/turn limit is reached
- Players choose to disengage (if allowed)

Check your campaign for specific completion conditions.
