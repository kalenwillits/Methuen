# Introduction

## What is Campaign Design?

As a campaign designer, you create all the content that makes Methuen games playable: resources, actions, maps, encounters, and victory conditions.

The framework provides structure. You provide content.

## What You'll Create

**Resources**
Define what actors track: Health, ActionPoints, Gold, Strength, etc.

**Actions**
Operations actors perform using if/do/then/else structure.

**Features**
Passive rules that modify core mechanics: initiative, movement, resource maximums.

**NPCs**
Autonomous opponents with behaviors and strategies.

**Maps and Encounters**
Scenarios that challenge players with terrain, objectives, and enemies.

**Victory Conditions**
How players win or lose.

## Prerequisites

Read the Methuen Player's Handbook first. Understanding the player experience is essential to designing campaigns.

## Core Design Principles

**Precision Over Ambiguity**
No game master exists to adjudicate unclear situations. Every rule must be unambiguous and mechanically resolvable.

Good: "Move up to Dexterity spaces per turn"
Bad: "Move a reasonable distance"

Good: "Deal 1d6+Strength damage"
Bad: "Deal significant damage"

**Work Within Constraints**
Core rules are fixed:
- If/do/then/else action structure
- Resources as positive integers
- Grid-based positioning
- Standard operators (+, -, *, /)

**Innovate Through Content**
Create unique experiences by choosing which resources matter, defining creative actions, designing compelling maps, and building interesting scenarios.

## Campaign Scope

**One-Shot** (1-3 hours)
- Single encounter
- 3-5 resources
- 5-8 actions
- Clear objective

**Short Campaign** (4-10 hours)
- 2-4 encounters
- 6-10 resources
- 10-15 actions
- Progressive difficulty

**Long Campaign** (10+ hours)
- Multiple encounters
- 10+ resources
- 15+ actions
- Complex systems

## Using This Guide

**Chapters 2-3** cover essential mechanics: actions and resources.

**Chapters 4-5** cover NPCs and world design.

**Chapter 6** provides reference materials and templates.

## Design Philosophy

**Start Simple**
Begin with core resources (Health, ActionPoints) and basic actions. Add complexity incrementally.

**Create Meaningful Choices**
Every action should present decisions: spend resources now or save? Target this enemy or that one? Move closer or maintain distance?

**Test Early and Often**
Playtest to find unclear rules and balance issues. Iterate based on feedback.

## Your First Campaign

Before diving deep, consider:

**What experience do you want to create?**
- Tactical combat
- Resource management
- Exploration
- Puzzle-solving

**What's the core gameplay loop?**
- What do players do each turn?
- What resources matter most?
- What creates interesting decisions?

**What's the victory condition?**
- Defeat all enemies
- Accumulate resources
- Survive X rounds
- Complete objectives

Keep these questions in mind as you learn the design tools.
